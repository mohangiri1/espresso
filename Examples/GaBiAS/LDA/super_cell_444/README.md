These are the input files for the 4 by 4 by 4 GaBiAs using LDA pseudopotentials
Here Bi atoms are replaced at 
Bi along [110] direction with reference As[0.0625 0.0625 0.0625]:
[0.3125 0.3125 0.0625]
[0.5625 0.5625 0.0625]
[0.8125 0.8125 0.0625]

Here, out of 64 As, 3 As are replaced by Bi atom ! So percentage doping would be 4.69%
